~numbex~ is a minor mode for GNU Emacs that helps you manage numbered
examples and reference to them in your buffer.  It is primarily aimed
at linguists, whose practice very often involves having example
sentences, formulas, or other objects given with a number that
uniquely identifies them in the text:

#+begin_example
Consider these two examples:

(1) One example.
(2) Another example.

If you look at (1)...
#+end_example

Now, this very good practice starts to get annoying when taking notes
in plain text.  Say for instance that you want to switch the two
examples above, or that you want to add another example before them.
To keep things tidy and unambiguous you'd have to change the number of
every other example, and also the number of every reference!  If you
make a mistake or you forget anything, you will end up with a mess and
there is no way to know, from the numbers alone what refers to what.
~numbex-mode~ takes care of all this for you.

~numbex~ should work in any major mode, and in particular it should
not conflict with the default behavior of ~org-mode~.  The fundamental
idea behind ~numbex~ is that the buffer text proper doesn't contain
any numbering itself, but only *numbex items* (that is, labeled
expressions with a certain form): the numbering is added to the buffer
as text properties.  The command ~numbex-toggle-display~ switches the
buffer back and forth from a state with and without the numbering.

There are no preset default keybindings, but it is a good idea to
define some for the two most common interactive commands: ~numbex-do~
and ~numbex-toggle-display~.  The other interactive commands,
explained below, are ~numbex-search~, ~numbe-refresh~,
~numbex-convert-to-latex~, ~numbex-convert-from-latex~ and
~numbex-write-out-numbers~.

** Basic usage with ~numbex-do~

A "numbex item" is a buffer substring whose delimiters are ~{[~ and
~]}~, and whose body consist of a *prefix* and a *label*.  The prefix
determines the kind of item:

|--------+--------------------------------------------|
| Prefix | Type of item                               |
|--------+--------------------------------------------|
| ~ex:~  | Example (introduces a new label)           |
| ~rex:~ | Reference to an example                    |
| ~pex:~ | Reference to immediately preceding example |
| ~nex:~ | Reference to immediately following example |
|--------+--------------------------------------------|

The *label* is the substring after the prefix in the item.  So for
instance ~{[ex:first]}~ is an example item whose label is ~first~.
Items can be unlabeled: ~{[ex:]}~.  There cannot be whitespace
characters inside an item: if you add any, they will be automatically
removed.  (This is to make sure that an item never ends up broken in
different lines, which would cause numbex not to recognize the item
anymore.)

While you can manipulate these items yourself (either manually or
programmatically), it is much more convenient to use the command
~numbex-do~.  If you invoke this command while point is on a numbex
item, it will allow you to edit the label, otherwise, it will let you
create a new item.  The convenience of using this command is that it
provides completion for selecting labels when you edit or create a
reference, and warns you when you are trying to use a non-unique label
when you edit or create a new example.  The interface of ~numbex-do~
lets you choose an option from a selection in the echo area.

*** Numbering of examples

Examples, whether labeled or not, are just numbered sequentially,
starting with ~(1)~ on the very first example in the buffer.

*** Numbering of references

The numbering of references depends on several factors.  Labeled
reference items (like ~{[rex:first-example]}~) inherit the same number
as the corresponding example item (in this case,
~{[ex:first-example]}~).  Unlabeled ones (like ~{[rex:]}~) receive the
same number as the example item immediately preceding them.

The special reference items ~pex:~ and ~nex:~ are almost never
unlabeled.  This is because numbex automatically assigns to them the
same label as the example that immediately precedes or follows them
(respectively).  If the state of the buffer changes as to which
example precedes or follows them, their label will change accordingly.
If you edit a ~pex:~ or ~nex:~ item with ~numbex-do~, it will be
automatically converted in a regular reference item with the new label
you selected.  These special items can remain unlabeled only as long
as there is no example in the buffer that precedes or follows them
(respectively), in which case ~pex:~ will be numbered as ~(0)~, ~nex:~
as the same number and example at the very end of the buffer would be
assigned.

Assuming that this is the whole buffer:

#+begin_example
{[ex:]} Odd example
{[ex:second-example]} One example.
{[ex:first-example]} Another example.

If you look at {[rex:second-example]} you will see that {[pex:first-example]}...
#+end_example

this is how ~numbex~ will number the items:

#+begin_example
(1) Odd example.
(2) One example.
(3) Another example.

If you look at (2) you will see that (3)...
#+end_example

** Other conveniences

When point is on an item, the underlying label is displayed in the
echo area.  If the item is a reference item, the echo area will also
display the context of the corresponding example item (its line).
This way, you will always have a clue as to what is referred to by the
item at point:

#+CAPTION: Displaying the label in the echo area.
[[./screenshots/numbex-display-label.png]]

Right after any invocation of ~numbex-do~ you will be reminded in the
echo area of the existence of duplicate labels (non-empty labels that
are being used by more than one example item):

#+CAPTION: Duplicate found warning in the echo area.
[[./screenshots/numbex-duplicate-found.png]]

These two features work even if the buffer is currently narrowed and
the example item you are referring to or the duplicate label are
outside of the narrowed portion of the buffer (that is, they are
currently inaccessible).  This way, the chances of you ending up with
a mess once you widen the buffer again are minimized.

*** Syntax highlighting

By default, numbex color-codes numbers corresponding to unlabeled
items or to items with a non-unique label.  This is done with whatever
text property the current font-lock uses to mark comments and warnings
(respectively).  If no font-lock is active, ~numbex~ uses gray and red
respectively.

#+begin_example
{[ex:]} Odd example
{[ex:second-example]} One example.
{[ex:first-example]} Another example.

If you look at {[rex:second-example]} you will see that
{[pex:first-example]} resembles this sentence:

{[ex:second-example]} An example.
#+end_example

If you want to change this default behavior, set the variables
~numbex-highlight-unlabeled~ and/or ~numbex-highlight-duplicates~ to
~nil~.

*** Exporting

You might want to use the complex of examples and references you
maintained with numbex in LaTeX.  ~numbex-convert-to-latex~ replaces
every example item with ~\label{ex:<label>}~ and every reference item
with ~(\ref{ex:<label>})~.  To convert in the other direction, use
~numbex-convert-from-latex~.

Also, you might want to export the notes you have maintained with
numbex in another plain text file where the numbers are actual text
content instead of text properties (for instance, you want to send a
plain text email with numbered examples).  This is a destructive
operation: it will necessarily remove information that cannot be
restored (namely, the labels).  Therefore, ~numbex-write-out-numbers~
will save the content of the buffer in a file (whose name is the name
of the current buffer prefixed by ~nb-~), where all the numbex items
are actually replaced by the numbers.

*** Searching

Finally, ~numbex-search~ is a convenient wrapper around ~occur~ that
lets you examine the items in the buffer: use it to have, in other
window, a grep-like overview of the lines that contain any item, or
any example, or any reference, or any item with the same label as the
item at point (if ~numbex-search~ is evaluated when point is on an
item).

** Dealing with large files

The numbering of items and the collection of information about labels
(duplicates etc.) is performed by ~numbex-refresh~.  By default, this
operation is performed automatically if the current buffer is in
~numbex-mode~ at these moments:

+ when ~numbex-mode~ is activated
+ every time Emacs is idle for 0.3 seconds (enough time not to be in
  the way of your typing)
+ when the buffer is saved or auto-saved
+ right after any time one of these functions is evaluated:
  + ~numbex-do~
  + ~numbex-toggle-display~

If you have less than a thousand numbex items in your buffer, you
shouldn't notice any significant lag.  If you have 500,
~numbex-refresh~ should take approximately 0.05 seconds, which makes
the process just about imperceptible.

However, if when you activate ~numbex-mode~ more than 1000 numbex
items are found, you will be asked whether you want to disable
automatic refresh.  If you disable it, ~numbex-refresh~ will only be
evaluated when you save the buffer (or when it is auto-saved) and of
course when you interactively call it as a command.  Regardless of
what you answer to that question, any time that there are more than
1000 numbex items in the buffer, ~numbex-refresh~ won't be evaluated
on the idle-timer every 0.3 seconds.  It is unlikely, however, that
you will ever have more than 1000 between examples and references in a
single buffer.  If you plan to keep notes with more than /ten
thousand/ items... it's better if you don't use ~numbex-mode~ at all.
